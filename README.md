    'apiKey' => 'your api key',

Refer to Features Test Cases for more usage examples.

Refer to Tingg API documentation for the required parameters reference for each method.

## Notes

-   Calling `authenticate()` is not automatic, you have to call it manually before making any request.

-   Calling `authenticate()` will keep the accessToken in memory for subsequent requests.

-   Calling `authenticate()` only supports the `client_credentials` grant type. And will return an array with the following keys: `token_type`, `expires_in`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`.

-   Error handling is not yet implemented, so you have to handle errors manually.

-   Methods accept an array of parameters, which are then converted to JSON before making the request. Refer to Tingg API documentation for the required parameters.

-   Methods array parameters are _NOT_ validated, so you have to make sure you pass the correct parameters. With exception of `construct()` method which validates the required parameters.

-   Method names are the same as the Tingg API endpoints.

-   The package uses [Guzzle](https://docs.guzzlephp.org/) to make HTTP requests. Version ^7.0 is used.

-   Function Return Types are not implemented yet, so you have to manually cast the return values to the expected type.
